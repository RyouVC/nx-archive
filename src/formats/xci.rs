//! The XCI (eXtendable Card Image) format is a Nintendo Switch game card image format.
//!
//! This format is the raw data from a Nintendo Switch game card, those little bitter
//! SD card-like things that you insert physically on top of the console.
//!
//! The cards themselves physically have a similar footprint to an SD card, but are slightly thicker
//! and less wide. The data inside is stored in an eMMC chip, which is soldered onto the card.
//! They are also coated with Denatonium Benzoate, a bittering agent, to discourage consumption.
//! Just in case you (or your pet, or your little sibling) get any ideas. No, the game cards taste horrible (by design).
